## Usage Examples

### Visual Testing Example

```swift
func testImageFilter() throws {
    // Arrange
    let inputImage = try loadTestImage(named: "test_image")
    
    // Act
    let filteredImage = applyFilter(to: inputImage)
    
    // Assert
    try VisualTestUtility.compareImages(
        actual: filteredImage,
        expected: "filtered_image_reference",
        tolerance: 0.01
    )
}
```

### Performance Testing Example

```swift
func testMergePerformance() throws {
    // Arrange
    let images = try loadTestImages(count: 8)
    
    // Act & Assert
    try measureExecutionTime(
        name: "hdr_merge_8_images",
        baselineValue: 150.0,  // 150ms baseline
        acceptableDeviation: 0.15  // 15% deviation allowed
    ) {
        _ = try mergeImagesForHDR(images)
    }
}
```

### Parameterized Testing Example

```swift
func testExposureAdjustment() throws {
    // Test cases with different exposure values
    let testCases = [
        (input: 0.0, expected: 1.0),
        (input: 1.0, expected: 2.0),
        (input: -1.0, expected: 0.5)
    ]
    
    // Run the test for each case
    try runParameterizedTest(with: testCases) { input, expected, index in
        let result = calculateExposureValue(input)
        XCTAssertEqual(result, expected, accuracy: 0.001)
    }
}
```

## Future Improvements

While we've made significant enhancements to the test infrastructure, there are additional improvements that could be made in the future:

1. **Advanced Mocking Framework**: Develop a more comprehensive mocking framework specific to camera and image processing components.

2. **Automated Test Generation**: Tools to automatically generate test cases based on input boundaries and edge cases.

3. **Enhanced Performance Analysis**: More sophisticated performance analysis tools with hardware-specific baselines.

4. **Test Coverage Expansion**: Tools to automatically identify untested code paths and generate test suggestions.

5. **Fuzzing Infrastructure**: Implement fuzzing capabilities to automatically generate invalid inputs for robust testing.

## Conclusion

The enhancements made to the HDR+ Swift test infrastructure provide a solid foundation for maintaining high code quality as the project evolves. By focusing on creating reusable, configurable test utilities, we've improved the testing experience without modifying the functional code of the project. These improvements will help ensure that the HDR+ Swift project remains robust, maintainable, and performant into the future.
