# Burst Photo

This is a macOS app written in Swift / SwiftUI / Metal that implements a simplified version of HDR+, the computational photography pipeline in Google Pixel phones. You can read more about HDR+ in Google's paper [Burst photography for high dynamic range and low-light imaging on mobile cameras](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.hdrplusdata.org/en//hdrplus.pdf).

If you are a researcher or you prefer Python/PyTorch, I suggest you check out [hdr-plus-pytorch](https://github.com/martin-marek/hdr-plus-pytorch).

# Example

I took a burst of 35 images at ISO 12,800 on Sony RX100-V and boosted it by +2EV. Here's a comparison of a single image from the burst vs. a merge of all the images.

To test motion-robustness, I compared a raw image, output from the app using `Robustness` set to `High`, and output from the app using `Robustness` set to `Low`. You can compare my results to Google's by opening Figure 6 in their [paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.hdrplusdata.org/en//hdrplus.pdf).

# Usage

To process a burst of DNG images, simply drag-and-drop them into the app. You can read more at [burst.photo/help/](https://burst.photo/help/).

# Download

You can download the app from the [Mac App Store](https://burst.photo/download/) or as a [GitHub release](https://github.com/martin-marek/hdr-plus-swift/releases).

# Features
- [x] DNG support
- [x] robust merge
- [x] mutli-threaded image loading
- [x] align+merge running in pure Metal

# TODO
- [ ] Fix progressbar getting stuck loading the first image
- [ ] ARM support â€“ requires recompiling Adobe DNG SDK
- [ ] 32-bit output - how can this be achieved in Adobe DNG SDK?
- [ ] super-resolution

Please feel free to contribute to any of these features or suggest other features.
