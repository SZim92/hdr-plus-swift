# [DEPRECATED] HDR+ Swift - CI Configuration
# This file format is deprecated and will be removed in a future update.
# Please use .github/workflow-config.yml for shared configuration instead.
#
# The new format is properly structured for loading with the load-config action
# and avoids GitHub Actions workflow validation errors.
